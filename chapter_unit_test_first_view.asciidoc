Testing a Simple Home Page with [keep-together]#Unit Tests#
-----------------------------------------------------------


We finished the last chapter with a functional test failing, telling us that it
wanted the home page for our site to have ``To-Do'' in its title. It's time to
start working on our application.

.Warning: Things Are About to Get Real
*******************************************************************************
The first two chapters were intentionally nice and light.  From now on, we
get into some more meaty coding.  Here's a prediction:  at some point, things
are going to go wrong.  You're going to see different results from what I say
you should see. This is a Good Thing, because it will be a genuine
character-building Learning Experience(TM). 

One possibility is that I've given some ambiguous explanations, and you've
done something different from what I intended. Step back and have a think about
what we're trying to achieve at this point in the book. Which file are we
editing, what do we want the user to be able to do, what are we testing and
why?  It may be that you've edited the wrong file or function, or are running
the wrong tests.  I reckon you'll learn more about TDD from these "stop and think"
moments than you do from all the times when following instructions and
copy-pasting goes smoothly.

Or it may be a real bug. Be tenacious, read the error message carefully (see <<read_tracebacks_aside>> a little later on in the chapter), and
you'll get to the bottom of it. It's probably just a missing comma, or
trailing slash, or maybe a missing _s_ in one of the Selenium find methods.
But, as <<lpthw,Zed Shaw put it so well>>, this kind of debugging is also an
absolutely vital part of learning, so do stick it out!

((("Test-Driven Development (TDD)", "additional resources")))((("getting help")))You
can always drop me an email (or try the
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/obey-the-testing-goat-book[Google
Group]) if you get really stuck.  Happy debugging!

Our First Django App, and Our First Unit Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


((("Django framework", "code structure in")))((("Django framework", "unit testing in", id="DJFunit03")))Django
encourages you to structure your code into 'apps': the theory is that
one project can have many apps, you can use third-party apps developed by other
people, and you might even reuse one of your own apps in a different
project...although I admit I've never actually managed it myself!  Still, apps
are a good way to keep your code organised.

Let's start an app for our to-do lists:

[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *python manage.py startapp lists*
----

That will create a folder called 'lists', next to 'manage.py' and the existing
'superlists' folder , and within it a number of placeholder files for things
like models, views, and, of immediate interest to us, tests:

Unit Tests, and How They Differ from Functional Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



((("unit tests", "vs. functional tests", secondary-sortas="functional tests")))((("functional tests (FTs)", "vs. unit tests", secondary-sortas="unit tests")))As
with so many of the labels we put on things, the line between unit tests and
functional tests can become a little blurry at times. The basic distinction,
though, is that functional tests test the application from the outside, from
the point of view of the user. Unit tests test the application from the
inside, from the point of view of the [keep-together]#programmer#.

The TDD approach I'm following wants our application to be covered by
both types of test. Our workflow will look a bit like this:

1.  We start by writing a 'functional test', describing the new functionality
    from the user's point of view.

2.  Once we have a functional test that fails, we start to think about how
    to write code that can get it to pass (or at least to get past its current
    failure). We now use one or more 'unit tests' to define how we want our
    code to behave--the idea is that each line of production code we write
    should be tested by (at least) one of our unit tests.

3.  Once we have a failing unit test, we write the smallest amount of
    'application code' we can, just enough to get the unit test to pass.
    We may iterate between steps 2 and 3 a few times, until we think the
    functional test will get a little further.

4.  Now we can rerun our functional tests and see if they pass, or get a
    little further.  That may prompt us to write some new unit tests, and
    some new code, and so on.

You can see that, all the way through, the functional tests are driving what 
development we do from a high level, while the unit tests drive what we do
at a low level.

Does that seem slightly redundant? Sometimes it can feel that way, but
functional tests and unit tests do really have very different objectives, and
they will usually end up looking quite different.  

NOTE: Functional tests should help you build an application with the right
functionality, and guarantee you never accidentally break it.  Unit tests
should help you to write code that's clean and bug free.

Enough theory for now—let's see how it looks in practice.


Unit Testing in Django
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



((("unit tests", "in Django", "writing basic", secondary-sortas="Django", id="UTdjango03")))Let's
see how to write a unit test for our home page view. Open up the new
file at 'lists/tests.py', and you'll see something like this:

[role="sourcecode currentcontents"]
.lists/tests.py
====
[source,python]
----
from django.test import TestCase

# Create your tests here.
----
====


Django has helpfully suggested we use a special version of `TestCase`, which
it provides. It's an augmented version of the standard `unittest.TestCase`,
with some additional Django-specific features, which we'll discover over the 
next few chapters.

You've already seen that the TDD cycle involves starting with a test that
fails, then writing code to get it to pass. Well, before we can even get that
far, we want to know that the unit test we're writing will definitely be
run by our automated test runner, whatever it is.  In the case of
'functional_tests.py', we're running it directly, but this file made by Django
is a bit more like magic. So, just to make sure, let's make a deliberately
silly failing test:

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py
====
[source,python]
----
from django.test import TestCase

class SmokeTest(TestCase):

    def test_bad_maths(self):
        self.assertEqual(1 + 1, 3)
----
====


Now let's invoke this mysterious Django test runner. As usual, it's a
'manage.py' [keep-together]#command#:


[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py test*]
Creating test database for alias 'default'...
F
======================================================================
FAIL: test_bad_maths (lists.tests.SmokeTest)
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "...python-tdd-book/lists/tests.py", line 6, in test_bad_maths
    self.assertEqual(1 + 1, 3)
AssertionError: 2 != 3

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 1 test in 0.001s

FAILED (failures=1)
System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
Destroying test database for alias 'default'...
----

Excellent.  The machinery seems to be working. This is a good point for a
commit:


[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git status*  # should show you lists/ is untracked
$ *git add lists*
$ *git diff --staged*  # will show you the diff that you're about to commit
$ *git commit -m "Add app for lists, with deliberately failing unit test"*
----


As you've no doubt guessed, the `-m` flag lets you pass in a commit message
at the command line, so you don't need to use an editor. It's up to you
to pick the way you like to use the Git command line; I'll just show you 
the main ones I've seen used.  The key rule is: 'make sure you always review
what you're about to commit before you do it'.


Django's MVC, URLs, and View Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~




((("Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern")))Django
is structured along a classic 'Model-View-Controller'
(MVC) pattern.  Well, 'broadly'.  It definitely does have models, but its
views are more like a controller, and it's the templates that are actually the
view part, but the general idea is there.  If you're interested, you can
look up the finer points of the discussion
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/faq/general/[in the Django FAQs].





Irrespective of any of that, as with any web server, Django's main job is to
decide what to do when a user asks for a particular URL on our site.
Django's workflow goes something like this:

1. An HTTP 'request' comes in for a particular 'URL'.
2. Django uses some rules to decide which 'view' function should deal with
  the request (this is referred to as 'resolving' the URL).
3. The view function processes the request and returns an HTTP 'response'.

So we want to test two things:

* Can we resolve the URL for the root of the site (``/'') to a particular
  view function we've made?

* Can we make this view function return some HTML which will get the 
  functional test to pass?

Let's start with the first. Open up 'lists/tests.py', and change our silly
test to something like this:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py
====
[source,python]
----
from django.urls import resolve
from django.test import TestCase
from lists.views import home_page  #<2>

class HomePageTest(TestCase):

    def test_root_url_resolves_to_home_page_view(self):
        found = resolve('/')  #<1>
        self.assertEqual(found.func, home_page)  #<1>
----
====

What's going on here?

<1> `resolve` is the function Django uses internally to resolve
    URLs and find what view function they should map to.  We're checking that
    `resolve`, when called with ``/'', the root of the site, finds a function
    called `home_page`.  

<2> What function is that?  It's the view function we're going to
    write next, which will actually return the HTML we want.  You can see from
    the `import` that we're planning to store it in 'lists/views.py'.

So, what do you think will happen when we run the tests?


[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py test*]
ImportError: cannot import name 'home_page' from 'lists.views'
----

It's a very predictable and uninteresting error: we tried to import something
we haven't even written yet. But it's still good news--for the purposes of
TDD, an exception which was predicted counts as an expected failure.
Since we have both a failing functional test and a failing unit test, we have
the Testing Goat's full blessing to code away.


At Last! We Actually Write Some Application Code!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is exciting, isn't it?  Be warned, TDD means that long periods of
anticipation are only defused very gradually, and by tiny increments.
Especially since we're learning and only just starting out, we only allow
ourselves to change (or add) one line of code at a time--and each time, we
make just the minimal change required to address the current test failure.

I'm being deliberately extreme here, but what's our current test failure? 
We can't import `home_page` from `lists.views`?  OK, let's fix that--and only
that.  In 'lists/views.py':

[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
====
[source,python]
----
from django.shortcuts import render

# Create your views here.
home_page = None
----
====

_"You must be joking!"_ I can hear you say.  

I can hear you because it's what I used to say (with feeling) when
my colleagues first demonstrated TDD to me.  Well, bear with me, and we'll talk
about whether or not this is all taking it too far in a little while.  But for
now, let yourself follow along, even if it's with some exasperation, and see
if our tests can help us write the correct code, one tiny step at a time.

We run the tests again:


[subs="specialcharacters,macros"]
----
$ pass:quotes[*python manage.py test*]

E

[[read_tracebacks_aside]]
.Reading Tracebacks
*******************************************************************************

((("tracebacks")))Let's
spend a moment talking about how to read tracebacks, since it's something
we have to do a lot in TDD. You soon learn to scan through them and pick up
relevant clues:

----
======================================================================
ERROR: test_root_url_resolves_to_home_page_view (lists.tests.HomePageTest)  <2>
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "...python-tdd-book/lists/tests.py", line 8, in

  File ".../django/urls/resolvers.py", line 394, in resolve

 ---------------------------------------------------------------------
[...]
----

<1> The first place you look is usually 'the error itself'. Sometimes that's
    all you need to see, and it will let you identify the problem immediately.
    But sometimes, like in this case, it's not quite self-evident.

<2> The next thing to double-check is: 'which test is failing?' Is it
    definitely the one we expected--that is, the one we just wrote?  In this case,
    the answer is yes.

<3> Then we look for the place in 'our test code' that kicked off the failure.
    We work our way down from the top of the traceback, looking for the
    filename of the tests file, to check which test function, and what line of
    code, the failure is coming from.  In this case it's the line where we call
    the `resolve` function for the "/" URL.

There is ordinarily a fourth step, where we look further down for any
of 'our own application code' which was involved with the problem.  In this
case it's all Django code, but we'll see plenty of examples of this fourth step
later in the book.

Pulling it all together, we interpret the traceback as telling us that, when
trying to resolve ``/'', Django raised a 404 error--in other words, Django
can't find a URL mapping for ``/''.  Let's help it out.

*******************************************************************************


urls.py
~~~~~~~



((("URL mappings")))Our
tests are telling us that we need a URL mapping. Django uses a file called
'urls.py' to map URLs to view functions. There's a main 'urls.py' for the whole
site in the 'superlists' folder. Let's go take a look:


[role="sourcecode currentcontents"]
.superlists/urls.py
====
[source,python]
----
"""superlists URL Configuration

The `urlpatterns` list routes URLs to views. For more information please see:
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/topics/http/urls/
Examples:
Function views
    1. Add an import:  from my_app import views
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  url(r'^$', views.home, name='home')
Class-based views
    1. Add an import:  from other_app.views import Home
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  url(r'^$', Home.as_view(), name='home')
Including another URLconf
    1. Import the include() function: from django.conf.urls import url, include
    2. Add a URL to urlpatterns:  url(r'^blog/', include('blog.urls'))
"""
from django.conf.urls import url
from django.contrib import admin

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
----
====

As usual, lots of helpful comments and default suggestions from Django.

WARNING: If your _urls.py_ looks different or if it mentions a function called
    `path` instead of `url`, it's because you've got the wrong version of
    Django.  This book is written for Django v1.11.  Take another look at
    the "<<pre-requisites>>" section and get the right version before you
    go any further.

A `url` entry starts with a regular expression that defines which URLs it
applies to, and goes on to say where it should send those requests--either to
a view function you've imported, or maybe to another 'urls.py' file somewhere
else.

The first example entry has the regular expression `^$`, which means
an empty string--could this be the same as the root of our site, which we've
been testing with ``/''?  Let's find out--what happens if we include it?

NOTE: If you've never come across regular expressions, you can get away with
    just taking my word for it, for now--but you should make a mental note to
    go learn about them.

We'll also get rid of the admin URL, because we won't be using the Django
admin site for now:


[role="sourcecode dofirst-ch03l003"]
.superlists/urls.py
====
[source,python]
----
from django.conf.urls import url
from lists import views

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$', views.home_page, name='home'),
]
----
====

Run the unit tests again, with *`python manage.py test`*:

----
[...]
TypeError: view must be a callable or a list/tuple in the case of include().
----

That's progress!  We're no longer getting a 404.

The traceback is messy, but the message at the end is telling us what's going
on: the unit tests have actually made the link between the URL "/" and the
`home_page = None` in 'lists/views.py', and are now complaining that the
`home_page` view is not callable. And that gives us a justification for
changing it from being `None` to being an actual function. Every single code
change is driven by the tests! 

Back in 'lists/views.py':


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/views.py
====
[source,python]
----
from django.shortcuts import render

# Create your views here.
def home_page():
    pass
----
====


And now?

----

Hooray! Our first ever unit test pass!  That's so momentous that I think it's
worthy of a commit:


[subs="specialcharacters,quotes"]
----
$ *git diff*  # should show changes to urls.py, tests.py, and views.py
$ *git commit -am "First unit test and url mapping, dummy view"*
----


That was the last variation on `git commit` I'll show, the `a` and `m` flags
together, which adds all changes to tracked files and uses the commit message
from the command line. 





WARNING: `git commit -am` is the quickest formulation, but also gives you the
    least feedback about what's being committed, so make sure you've done a
    `git status` and a `git diff` beforehand, and are clear on what changes are
    about to go in.


Unit Testing a View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

((("unit tests", "in Django", "unit testing a view", secondary-sortas="Django")))On
to writing a test for our view, so that it can be something more than a 
do-nothing function, and instead be a function that returns a real response
with HTML to the browser. Open up 'lists/tests.py', and add a new
'test method'. I'll explain each bit:


[role="sourcecode"]
.lists/tests.py
====
[source,python]
----
from django.urls import resolve
from django.test import TestCase
from django.http import HttpRequest

from lists.views import home_page


class HomePageTest(TestCase):

    def test_root_url_resolves_to_home_page_view(self):
        found = resolve('/')
        self.assertEqual(found.func, home_page)


    def test_home_page_returns_correct_html(self):
        request = HttpRequest()  #<1>
        response = home_page(request)  #<2>
        html = response.content.decode('utf8')  #<3>
        self.assertTrue(html.startswith('<html>'))  #<4>
        self.assertIn('<title>To-Do lists</title>', html)  #<5>
        self.assertTrue(html.endswith('</html>'))  #<4>
----
====

What's going on in this new test?  

<1> We create an `HttpRequest` object, which is what Django will see when
    a user's browser asks for a page.

<2> We pass it to our `home_page` view, which gives us a response. You won't be
    surprised to hear that this object is an instance of a class called
    `HttpResponse`.

<3> Then, we extract the `.content` of the response.  These are the raw bytes,
    the ones and zeros that would be sent down the wire to the user's browser.
    We call `.decode()` to convert them into the string of HTML that's being
    sent to the user.

<4> We want it to start with an `<html>` tag which gets closed at the end.

<5> And we want a `<title>` tag somewhere in the middle, with the words
    "To-Do lists" in it--because that's what we specified in our functional test.

Once again, the unit test is driven by the functional test, but it's also
much closer to the actual code--we're thinking like programmers now.

Let's run the unit tests now and see how we get on:

----
TypeError: home_page() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given
----


The Unit-Test/Code Cycle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


((("unit tests", "in Django", "unit-test/code cycle", secondary-sortas="Django")))((("unit-test/code cycle")))((("Test-Driven Development (TDD)", "concepts", "unit-test/code cycle")))We
can start to settle into the TDD 'unit-test/code cycle' now:

1. In the terminal, run the unit tests and see how they fail.
2. In the editor, make a minimal code change to address the current test failure.

And repeat! 

The more nervous we are about getting our code right, the smaller and more
minimal we make each code change--the idea is to be absolutely sure that each
bit of code is justified by a test.

This may seem laborious, and at first, it will be.  But once you get into the
swing of things, you'll find yourself coding quickly even if you take
microscopic steps--this is how we write all of our production code at work.

Let's see how fast we can get this cycle going:

* Minimal code change:

be a little baffled, perhaps keen to hear a justification for all these tests,
